### PSU
- block:

  - include: "{{ patch_file }} patch={{ item }}"
    with_items:

### Save latest applied PSU as Base Snapshot for OJVM. Why? OJVM can't be appied over base release. They requires a DB PSU.

### OJVM define base Snapshot
# Will define it if not already done by the PSU above task. i.e: param_type is defined and "OJVM"

### BP
- block:

  - name : Define snapshot base version to rollback when vm_reload is called.
