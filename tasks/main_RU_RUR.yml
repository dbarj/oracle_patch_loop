### Will Run RU + OJVM + RUR for given version

- name : Define version

### RU
- block:

  # Execute for base release
  - include: "{{ patch_file }}"
    vars:
      patch : { type : RU , id : 0, patch_number : 0 }
    when:
      - 0 == (param_patch | int)      or param_patch == -1
      - 0 >= (param_patch_from | int) or param_patch_from == -1
      - 0 <= (param_patch_to | int)   or param_patch_to == -1

  # Execute for every RU
  - include: "{{ patch_file }}"
    loop: "{{ lookup('vars', patch_list) | flatten(levels=1) }}"

  when: param_type is undefined or param_type == "RU"

### Save latest applied RU as Base Snapshot for OJVM. Why? OJVM can't be appied over base release. They requires a DB RU.
- block:

  - name: Get latest RU ID
    set_fact:
      latest_RU_id: "{{ lookup('vars', patch_list) | json_query(filter_qry) | max }}"

  - name: "Latest RU"
    debug: msg="Latest RU ID - {{ latest_RU_line }}"

  # Save lastest RU as a new snapshot - Also changes vm_snapshot variable to it (for OJVM).
  - include: vm_savestate.yml
    when: latest_RU_line == latest_processed

  when: param_type is undefined or param_type == "RU"

### OJVM define base Snapshot
# Will define it if not already done by the RU above task. i.e: param_type is defined and "OJVM"
- block:

  - name: Get latest RU ID
    set_fact:
      latest_RU_id: "{{ lookup('vars', patch_list) | json_query(filter_qry) | max }}"
    vars:

  - name : Generate Snapshot Name
    set_fact:
      vm_snapshot: "{{ db_version }} RU {{ latest_RU_id }}"

  - name: "Base Snapshot will be {{ vm_snapshot }}"
    debug: msg="Base Snapshot will be {{ vm_snapshot }}"

  when: param_type is defined and param_type == "OJVM"

### OJVM
- block:

  # Execute for every OJVM
  - include: "{{ patch_file }}"
    loop: "{{ lookup('vars', patch_list) | flatten(levels=1) }}"
    loop_control:
      loop_var: patch
      label: "{{ patch.id }}"
    when:
      - patch.type == "OJVM"
      - patch.id == (param_patch | int)      or param_patch == -1
      - patch.id >= (param_patch_from | int) or param_patch_from == -1
      - patch.id <= (param_patch_to | int)   or param_patch_to == -1

  when: param_type is undefined or param_type == "OJVM"

### RUR
- block:

  - name : Define snapshot base version to rollback when vm_reload is called.
    set_fact:
      vm_snapshot: "{{ patch_base }}"

  # Execute for every RUR
  - include: "{{ patch_file }}"

    when:
      - patch.type == "RUR"
      - patch.id == (param_patch | int)      or param_patch == -1
      - patch.id >= (param_patch_from | int) or param_patch_from == -1
      - patch.id <= (param_patch_to | int)   or param_patch_to == -1

  when: param_type is undefined or param_type == "RUR"
